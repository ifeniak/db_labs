##My first lab:


According to the variant of the task (table 1) to develop a detailed project of the specified database and
implement it using the graphical tool Management Studio (MS SQL
SERVER) or MySQL Workbench, and check for functionality.
2. Demonstrate the completed database project on a computer to the teacher.
3. Based on the results of the work performed, draw up a report and submit it.
Task
1. Create a database (DB).
2. In this database to create a scheme with a name that corresponds to the name of the student. All newly created
objects must belong to this scheme.
3. Build all necessary objects (tables, primary keys, secondary keys, foreign keys,
indices, test constraints) for the specified database.
4. Make at least 10 abstract records in each database table (if the number is known
not limited to logic).
5. Create a diagram for a fully designed database. Tables should be displayed on
chart in standard mode (column name, data type, allow null values) Relationships between
tables to adjust so that they indicate between which columns they are
establish a connection.
Designation: P.K. - primary key; U.I. - unique index;
I. - non-unique index; CHECK - test constraint.
